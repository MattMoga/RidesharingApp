# RidesharingApp

This project is a simulation of a simple Uber-like application developed as part of a university project. It includes various functionalities such as ride-sharing and food delivery services, implemented using different data structures to represent service requests and drivers.

## Features

- **CityMap**: Represents the logic for the address, block, and zone functions within a 9x9 grid of city blocks.
- **Driver**: Simulates a car driver with attributes like ID, name, car model, license plate, address, and status.
- **TMUberDelivery**: Simulates a food delivery service with attributes for restaurant and food order ID.
- **TMUberRegistered**: Registers all drivers and users through file input.
- **TMUberRide**: Simulates a ride service with attributes for number of passengers and whether an XL ride is requested.
- **TMUberService**: Abstract class that generalizes ride or delivery services.
- **TMUberSystemManager**: Contains the main logic of the system, tracking users, drivers, and service requests.
- **TMUberUI**: Command-line interface for interacting with the system.
- **User**: Simulates a user with attributes like account ID, name, address, wallet, rides, and deliveries.
